Recursion

1. In your own words, what is recursion?
    Recursion is the act of a function calling itself.
2. Why is it necessary to have a base case?
    A base case is required to end the program. Otherwise an infinite loop will occur
    and an attempt to run the program would result in a maximum recursion depth error.

Graphs

1. What is a graph?
    A graph is a data structure made of nodes connected by edges that can be directed
    or non-directed. Each node has an adjacency list that contains all of the nodes
    it shares an edge with.
2. How is a graph different from a tree?
    Graphs can differ from trees in that they can contain loops and can be non-directed.
    Trees are acyclic, directed graphs.
3. Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.
    It would be good to use a graph to model the required steps for installing a
    software package.


Performance of Different Data Structures
** I assumed the linked list and the DLL had a head and tail.

Python List (Array)         O(1)    O(n)    O(1)    O(n)    O(n)     O(1)

Sorting

1. Describe in words how the Bubble Sort algorithm works.
    Bubble sort compares two indexes at a time and swaps
    the larger item to the end of the array. Thus, the biggest
    item "bubbles" up to the end.
2. Describe in words how the Merge Sort algorithm works.
    Merge sort turns every item in a list into a sorted list of one item
    and then compares the first item in each list, adding the smaller
    item to a new result list until nothing remains to sort.
3. Describe in words how the Quick Sort algorithm works.
    The quick sort algorithm uses the item at a certain index as a "pivot" point
    to which each of the other items are compared and placed to the left if smaller
    or to the right if larger. The same steps are then taken for the items to the left and
    right of the pivot point. Quick sort is fast but not a stable sort (doesn't always preserve
    order).
